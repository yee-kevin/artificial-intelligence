### Homework
#### 1. HW1 [Code] - Word Ladder & Flight Itinerary Search
Solving the Word Ladder & Flight Itinerary problems using tree search (breadth_first_tree_search, depth_first_tree_search) and graph search (depth_first_graph_search, breadth_first_graph_search, uniform_cost_search, depth_limited_search, iterative_deepening_search and astar_search).  
Word Ladder: In a word ladder puzzle, you are given a start word and a goal word. You must transform the start word into the goal word by transforming one letter at a time,
and all intermediate words must be valid as well.  
Flight Itinerary: A flight has a starting city and time and an ending city and time. Cities are represented as strings and times as integers. Using a start city, starting time, destination city and deadline time, find the sequence of flights, starting in the starting city, leaving sometime at or after the starting time, and arriving at the destination before (or at) the deadline.
